This is not impacting users that still use Windows XP and Office 2007 (IE7), but rolling back is not an option. The issue occurs when a user attempts to edit a document. At first they receive a message indicating that the office product couldn't connect to the server to execute the save. Closing and reopening and trying to open the document then results in an error: \"No connectivity with the server. The file can't be opened because the server couldn't be contacted.\" This occurs for all files they then attempt to open.\nBACKGROUND: Testing has revealed an issue that appears to be on the client end. Basically, these Win7/Office2010 machines initially do not have the issue. When they are first joined to the network (using a standard image), they can edit documents in SP2007 without issue. As time goes by and various updates (patches, Group Policies, etc.) are applied, SOMETHING CHANGES and they start receiving the error.\nFor awhile, we believed Java to be the culprit due to it being one of the two program updates (QuickTime was the other) that were applied to our test client machine between when it was working fine and when the user started getting the error. When we initially tested this theory by removing Java 1.6 update 37 (leaving only update 33) the user stopped getting the error and was able to edit again. At this point, we also noticed on a machine that still had update 37 that users other than the primary (who was most likely logged on when the update was applied to their machine) were able to edit without the errors. EUREKA! NOT SO FAST. It turned out that this ability to edit was short-lived. Before long, all users were getting the edit error on the machine whether it had update 37 or only 33. Java theory - disproved.\nThis ability to edit has occasionally returned for short periods of time with some of the edits tried on the client machine (see below), but it never takes long for the error to resurface.\nResolutions Tried (& Failed) on the Client Machines\n-Adding a Registry Key for BasicAuthLevel with a value =2\n-Using IE 64-bit to open files\n-Removing Java 1.6 Patch 37\n-Making a fake proxy in IE\n", "", "2007 document-library office-integration internet-explorer windows-7"], "2454474": ["How to implement OpenDNS style proxying of web traffic", "I have a requirement that I believe may be impossible and wanted to confirm this with experts in this community.\nA client wants us to configure a DNS server to point all non-whitelisted domains to an IP address of a server on the internet. This server should forward / redirect all non-http traffic to an IP address associated with the real DNS record as accurately as possible. However, for all port 80 traffic, it should intercept the traffic and forward to a web proxy. This could in theory be possible if we had a large block of public IP addresses that could intelligently route based on the sender's IP to the proper destination, but the engineering effort required there to keep the DNS request and subsequent requests to that same domain in sync would be immense. Not to mention we would be limited from a concurrency perspective.This is probably similar to how OpenDNS does their DNS+Proxying, but they only seem to do it for google.com. This needs to work for an arbitrary set of domains (potentially all of them).\nIs the above approach feasible? If not, are there other ways this problem can be approached short of requiring specialized gateway hardware? \nIdeally the system will minimize bandwidth usage & latency for non-http traffic without requiring anything besides DNS or firewall configuration.

In other words,\n\nwill only call the \"readjust\" handler for the first element with class \"all-over-the-page\", even if there are many elements on the page with that class.  The \".trigger()\" method, on the other hand, would affect all of them.\nI realize that I can use \".each()\" to get around this (or simply write my own substitute that does that for me), but is there some rationale for why the two are different in this respect?  It kind-of makes no sense to me.  (I understand of course that it almost certainly can't be changed now.)\nedit to clarify:\nIt's probably easier to understand why I'm scratching my head over this if I provide a context in the style of code I've actually got.  When I put together code for various \"widget\" features on a page, that often involves event handlers. A good example is a form of some sort that's got some fields whose relevance is controlled by a checkbox, or radio button, or selector. A common instance of that is the \"Shipping Address\" checkbox that shows up on a zillion e-commerce sites: if the checkbox is checked, the shipping address is disabled and the billing address is used.\nNow consider that some other code may, for its own reasons that are totally independent of the checkbox-control widget, actually do things to the form that may include updating checkbox settings programmatically. In that case, that other widget code may want to use \"triggerHandler()\" to tell any widgets, \"hey I've updated some stuff, so you might want to re-check the current status and adjust if necessary.\"\nThus, if \".triggerHandler()\" would operate on all selected elements, I could use:\n\nand all those handlers could run and do whatever they need.

With respect to the morphism $X \\to X'$ the component $C$ is then contracted. If $f$ contracts $C$, so $f$ can possibly factor through $X'$.

The first statement I took from a paper I have been reading, but I believe can also be found in Isaacs' Character Theory of Finite Groups as an exercise.  The second comes directly from Isaacs' Finite Group Theory.\n\nFor both statements, let $X$ be a set of representatives for the $(H,K)$-double cosets in a group $G$, where $H$ and $K$ are subgroups and $G$ is finite.\nMackey's Theorem:  Let $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$ be characters of $H$ and $K$, respectively.

This is how Isaacs defines the transfer homomorphism in his book (after which he proves the transfer independent of the choice and order of transversal in the pretransfer).\nMy question is, how are these two theorems related?  This post on MO gives a representation theoretic interpretation of the transfer, so it seems like the first theorem ought to be a stronger version of the second (but I cannot prove it).

Or do you think this is a bad idea?\nFor those unfamiliar with the book, here is a list of the topics discussed in the chapters:\n\nChapter 1 deals with the most fundamental concepts of object-orientation: objects, classes and methods. It gives a solid, hands-on introduction to these concepts without going into the details of Java syntax. It also gives a first look at some source code. We do this by using an example of graphical shapes which can be interactively drawn, and a second example of a simple laboratory class enrolment system. \nChapter 2 opens up class definitions and investigates how Java source code is written to create behavior of objects. We discuss how to define fields and implement methods. Here, we also introduce the first types of statements. The main example is an implementation of a ticket machine. We also look back to the laboratory class example from chapter 1 to investigate that a bit further. \nChapter 3 then enlarges the picture to discuss interaction of multiple objects. We see how objects can collaborate by invoking each other's methods to perform a common task. We also discuss how one object can create other objects. A digital alarm clock display is discussed that uses two number display objects to show hours and minutes. As a second major example, we examine a simulation of an email system in which messages can be sent between mail clients. \nIn Chapter 4, we continue by building more extensive structures of objects. Most importantly, we start using collections of objects. We implement an electronic notebook and an auction system to introduce collections. At the same time, we discuss iterations over collection and have a first look at loops. The first collection being used is an ArrayList. In the second half of the chapter we introduce arrays as a special form of a collection, and the for loop as another form of a loop. We discuss an implementation of a web log analyzer as an example for array use. \nChapter 5 deals with libraries and interfaces. We introduce the Java standard library and discuss some important library classes. More importantly, we explain how to read and understand the library documentation. The importance of writing documentation in software development projects is discussed, and we end by practicing how to write suitable documentation for our own classes. Random, Set and Map are examples of classes that we encounter in this chapter. We implement an Eliza-like dialogue system and a graphical simulation of a bouncing ball to apply these classes. \nChapter 6, titled Well-behaved objects, deals with a whole group of issues connected to producing correct, understandable, and maintainable classes. It covers issues ranging from writing clear, understandable code - including style and commenting - to testing and debugging. Test strategies are introduced and a number of debugging methods are discussed in detail. We use an example of a diary for appointment scheduling and an implementation of an electronic calculator to discuss these topics. \nIn Chapter 7, we discuss more formally the issues of dividing a problem domain into classes for implementation. We introduce issues of designing classes well, including concepts such as responsibility-driven design, coupling, cohesion, and refactoring. An interactive, text-based, adventure game (World of Zuul) is used for this discussion. We go through several iterations of improving the internal class structure of the game and extending its functionality, and end with a long list of proposals for extensions that may be done as student projects. \nChapters 8 and 9 introduce inheritance and polymorphism with many of the related detailed issues. We discuss a simple database of CDs and videos to illustrate the concepts. Issues of code inheritance, subtyping, polymorphic method calls and overriding are discussed in detail. \nIn Chapter 10 we implement a predator/prey simulation. This serves to discuss additional abstraction mechanisms based on inheritance, namely interfaces and abstract classes. \nChapter 11 introduces two new examples: an image viewer and a sound player. Both examples serve to discuss how to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs).\nChapter 12 then picks up the difficult issue of how to deal with errors. Several possible problems and solutions are discussed, and Java's exception handling mechanism is discussed in detail. We extend and improve an address book application to illustrate the concepts. \nChapter 13 steps back to discuss in more detail the next level of abstraction: how to structure a vaguely described problem into classes and methods. In previous chapters we have assumed that large parts of the application structure already exist, and we have made improvements. Now it is time to discuss how we can get started from a clean slate. This involves detailed discussion of what the classes should be that implement our application, how they interact, and how responsibilities should be distributed. We use class-responsibilities-collaborators (CRC) cards to approach this problem, while designing a cinema booking system. \nIn Chapter 14, we try to bring everything together and integrate many topics from the previous chapters of the book. It is a complete case study, starting with the application design, through design of the class interfaces, down to discussing many important functional and non-functional characteristics and implementation details.

The title band Split Type attribute is set to \"Immediate\".\nThe dynamic subreport have three Static text components (Label 1 on the 1st line, Label 2 on the second and Label 3 on the third), all of them have the Position Type set to Float. But Label 2 has PrintWhenExpression set to Boolean.FALSE and RemoveLineWhenBlank set to TRUE. So Label 2 is hidden and Label 3 is moved to Label 2's place under Label 1.\nSo basically the dynamic subreport and the static one have the same structure and should behave the same way when printed inside a report. But that's not the case in this little example.\nIn the master report I'm using a subreport component inside the detail band ( the split type of the detail band is set to Immediate ) and using a JREmptyDataSource with 90 empty rows. When pointing the subreport component to the static subreport, the pdf output generated by jasperreports is corrrect. But when using the dynamic subreport, jasperreports leaves an empty space (that is used when using the static subreport) at the end of the first page and jumps to the next page to print Label 3.\nIn the real case that I have a problem with, I have a subreport that contains more than 20 lines with Static Text and Text Field components, most to them with printWhenExpression set to a field or a parameter and RemoveLineWhenBlank set to TRUE.

It seem loads of people are facing this situation that is just a mix between the scopes available:\n-Application scope settings are not meant to be modified during Runtime but are shared by all user.\n-User scope settings have the advantage to be able to be modified during Runtime but of course... are user dependent! \nWith researching, it seems some people are using \"brutal solution\": they define the targetted settings with an application scope, and hardcode opening and modification of the app.config XML file during Runtime (as long as they don't have access restriction problem??): it's seem to me a little bit messy, but why not... \n1-Path solution: Like some other, I was also thinking of keeping all the setting with a user scope and changing the storing path to share the same file between all the users. Is seems a good solution, but as I have also some \"real\" user dependant settings, it involve having two user.config files with two different path: I am not sure yet it is doable and a good practice?\n2-Changing default values: Another solution would be to change the default value of the user settings to use them as a kind of \"application scope\" (by calling reset() in program launching). If I am right, all the modified user settings are stored in the user.config file (In the user Local directory). The default user settings are stored in the app.config file under a section userSettings. I am not sure if it is possible to modify it during runtime and if so, I don't know how!! (With DefaultSettingValueAttribute !?) (To me, this section is different of the applicationSetting one that contains the application scope settings in read only during Runtime). This solution, if possible, seems to me the more practical and easy but again, not sure if best practice!!!)\nLast solution would be to store the targeted parameters in a totally different file and not using the settings systems provide by VS.
